I do client-side development (React, es6 etc.) and UX design, while my colleague does Ruby on Rails, DevOps and system administration. We are high-skilled, self-managing, and have worked together on several complex projects.<p>We work remotely and are based in a small Central European country, but we&#x27;re happy to visit US based clients when required. We are looking to charge $80+&#x2F;per person&#x2F;per hour.<p>The biggest hurdle is finding the first $80+&#x2F;h client, as we never took the time to grow our professional networks (subcontracting will do that to you).<p>I&#x27;ve read patio11&#x27;s essays and those of many other similar authors, but most of the advice is based on local consulting.<p>Are there any HN-ers who are working 100% remotely outside the US, and have been able to earn $13+k&#x2F;month consistently?
