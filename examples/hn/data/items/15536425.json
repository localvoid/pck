We&#x27;re based in the USA, they are in Canada. We have a year of checks to deposit for the monthly fee. This is fine but I have to go into the bank and deposit via a teller due to CAD funds. Our monthly fee per customer is $650-1300 USD.<p>Is there an easier way to accept payments from Canadian customers? We do have a business banking account with Chase in the USA. I see options like TransferWise.com and it actually comes out cheaper than Chase due to the exchange rate being more favorable (even with the 1% fee). But it doesn&#x27;t look like it is setup for recurring payments. I&#x27;ll go ask them. We could use something like Stripe but the fees are higher and I don&#x27;t know if our customers want to pay by credit card (I don&#x27;t know B2B payment conventions in Cananda).<p>I am asking here to possibly get advice&#x2F;suggestions based on experience as there appear to be a lot of options.","time":1508788595,"title":"Ask HN: USA-based SaaS and Candian payments?","type":"story"}
