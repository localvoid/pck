It has been one of my dreams for a long time, and I finally got the urge by accepting a 1 year contract engagement.<p>Fiduciary and legal considerations have already been considered (C-Corps&#x2F;LLCs, health insurance via my wife, quarterly taxes via accountant).<p>I just want to know all the more subtle things they don&#x27;t tell you about going freelance when you start out. Like for example, my first job on my own is a relatively safe subcontractor role, but most engagements are much shorter and riskier. How soon before my contract ends should I begin lining up other work?<p>What about marketing myself? I know consulting firms generally only work 4 out of 5 days a week for their clients , how should I spend that 5th day?<p>Any other suggestions would be great. This is both an exciting and terrifying time for me, and even though the contract is signed, I am freaking out a little bit.","time":1508809829,"title":"Ask HN: I just struck out on my own as a consultant.
